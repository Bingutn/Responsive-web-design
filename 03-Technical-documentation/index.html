              <h3>What is basketball?</h3>
              <p>Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent’s goal, an elevated horizontal hoop and net called a basket.

              <h3>How does basketball exercise your body?</h3>
              <p>Basketball is a dynamic sport that builds stamina from the short sprints required of running up and down the length of the court. Movements distinct to basketball, such as jumping to take a shot or to grab a rebound, require frequent muscle contractions, which can build muscular endurance. Additional weight training is recommended for basketball players in order to improve their performance on the court.

              <summary>What is photography?</summary>
              <p>Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera, usually via a digital sensor or film, to create an image. With the right camera equipment, you can even photograph wavelengths of light invisible to the human eye, including UV, infrared, and radio.</p>

            <h3>The Three Fundamental Camera Settings You Should Know</h3>
            <li><i><a class='camera-tip' href='https://photographylife.com/what-is-shutter-speed-in-photography'>Shutter speed</a></i> : The length of time the camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important effects on how your images will appear.</li>
            <li><i><a class='camera-tip' href='https://photographylife.com/what-is-aperture-in-photography'>Aperture</a></i> : Can be defined as the opening in a lens through which light passes to enter the camera. It is an easy concept to understand if you just think about how your eyes work. As you move between bright and dark environments, the iris in your eyes either expands or shrinks, controlling the size of your pupil.</li>
            <li><i><a class='camera-tip' href='https://photographylife.com/what-is-iso-in-photography'>ISO</a></i> : Simply a camera setting that will brighten or darken a photo. As you increase your ISO number, your photos will grow progressively brighter. For that reason, ISO can help you capture images in darker environments, or be more flexible about your aperture and shutter speed settings.</li>

            <h3>Why is sleep important?</h3>
            <p>Sleep plays a vital role in good health and well-being throughout your life. The way you feel while you are awake depends in part on what happens while you are sleeping. During sleep, your body is working to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health.
<br /><br />
In children and teens, sleep also helps support growth and development. Getting inadequate sleep over time can raise your risk for chronic (long-term) health problems. It can also affect how well you think, react, work, learn, and get along with others. Learn how sleep affects your heart and circulatory system, metabolism, respiratory system, and immune system and how much sleep is enough.</p>

            <h3>What is a Chronotype?</h3>
            <p>A chronotype is a classification system used to help understand sleep and productivity schedules, including when you’re most active and alert throughout the day. While there is still some research to be done on what exactly determines your chronotype, experts including sleep coach Alex Savy agree that they are genetically preconditioned, “courtesy of the PER3 gene that defines one’s circadian patterns.”
<br /><br />
In addition to your PER3 gene, your chronotype is measured through your body’s biological clock. This means that being a night owl or early riser is not only a personal preference, but is also based on your body’s natural activity, alertness, and rest rhythms.
<br /><br />
People typically fall into one of four chronotype categories: the bear, the wolf, the lion, and the dolphin. Each chronotype is loosely based on the relative animal’s sleep patterns and habits, so let’s dive in to discover which chronotype you most closely align with.</p>

                <summary>The Bear Chronotype</summary>
                <p>Much like its namesake, the bear chronotype follows the solar cycle, and usually doesn’t have much trouble waking up in the morning or sleeping through the night. This chronotype is most productive in the morning, and will typically struggle with an afternoon slump after lunch, generally around 2–4 p.m. Eight hours of sleep is typical for a bear, and normal sleep hours are usually between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.

              <summary>The Wolf Chronotype</summary>
              <p>Just like their real life counterparts, wolf chronotypes are most productive at night. The wolf needs more time to hit snooze in the morning to get all the energy they need to sustain their two bursts of creative energy: the first around noon, and the second coming around 6 p.m. when most others have finished their work for the day.

              <summary>The Lion Chronotype</summary>
              <p>The early lion gets the worm. This chronotype feels most alive in the morning with energy levels peaking before noon, and is typically able to complete massive amounts of work before lunch. Waking up early is a breeze for lions and everything tends to run smoothly until midday. Just as fast as energy for a lion is gained, it’s lost.

              <summary>The Dolphin Chronotype</summary>
              <p>The insomniac of the water, actual dolphins sleep with half of their brain on at a time — this helps them stay alert and aware of predators. Dolphins have a hard time waking up in the morning, but once they get going, their productivity reaches its peak around mid-morning.
